# 1. Creates a variable called `name` and assigns your name to it.
# 2. Creates a variable called `age` and assigns your age (integer) to it.
# 3. Prints a message like this: "My name is \<name\> and I am \<age\> years old."


def my_code():
    pass


# Press the green button in the gutter to run the script.
